** This project was generated with `Angular CLI` (https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 10.2.0.

    - Implemented main list of products, pagination, sorting, details, shopping cart, order history and so on.
    
    - 3 Angularfire collections: products, cart and orders.

# How to check it out

** You need to have the angular cli installed. If you don't have it run `npm install -g @angular/cli`.

** Run `ng s` for the app to start. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. 
   The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

** If the app doesn't start properly it is probably `expired backend service`.
   Please contact me so I can make a new connection for you.

** The Create, Edit and Delete of products are `allowed and accessible` for 1 account only. 
   Log in the app with `admin@gmail.com / 111111` and you will see it :). 
   All other accounts are concidered as casual users.

** I hope you like it, enjoy!
